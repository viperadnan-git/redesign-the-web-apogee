            <p>
                It focuses primarily on higher education and research in
                engineering and sciences. After expansion to a campus in Dubai,
                it has become the first international deemed university,
                spearheading in science, engineering, management and research
                with five established campuses and 15 academic departments.

            <p>
                The institute is backed by the Aditya Birla Group and is one of
                the first six institutes to be awarded the Institute of Eminence
                status in 2018. BITS conducts the All-India computerized
                entrance examination, BITSAT (BITS Admission Test). Admission is
                purely assessed by the BITSAT examination. The fully residential
                institute is privately supported. The institute was established
                in its present form in 1964. During this period, the institute's
                transformation from a regional engineering college to a national
                university was backed by G.D. Birla. The university has expanded
                its campuses from Pilani (Jhunjhunu) to Sancoale (South Goa),
                Hyderabad, Dubai and Mumbai. Through its highly successful and
                widespread alumni network spanning globally across varied
                fields, BITS Pilani has made a significant impact on corporates,
                academia, research, entrepreneurship, arts and social activism.
